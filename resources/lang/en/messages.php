The roots are collected in the autumn of the first year of growth and in the spring of the second prior to the appearance of the floral shaft. Leaves are collected between spring and summer in the second year before the flowers appear.",

    'ingredienti_paragrafo_4' => "Properties and Indications for use: burdock is known as an excellent fortifier of the immune system, a tonic for the liver, the kidneys and the lungs. It purifies the blood and is able to neutralise toxins and to clean out the lymphatic system. It is able to destroy bacteria and fungus and acts as an anti-tumour agent. It is an internal and external remedy in the treatment of the more common skin disorders. It has been recognized for its diuretic properties and acts as stimulant in liver and bile disorders. When used internally it performs a regulatory effect in conditions of diabetes and hypoglycaemia due to the presence of inulin in the root (up to 45%) and vitamins from group B which interact in sugar metabolism.",
    'ingredienti_paragrafo_5' => "In the Far East it is used for its strengthening and nutritional properties. In 502 A.D. in China, it was cited as a remedy by the name of \"Niu bang\". It was used by the American Indian Micmac and Menomonee tribes. Ayurvedic medicine recognizes its beneficial action on blood and plasma as well as its use in treating skin allergies, fevers and kidney stones.<br>
                                  Many scientific studies have demonstrated the anti-tumour activity of burdock on animals. The expression, \"the burdock factor\", was coined by scientists from the Kawasaki School of Medicine in Okayama, Japan. Laboratory studies have discovered that \"the burdock factor\" is active in fighting HIV (the AIDS virus). The inulin contained in burdock is able to stimulate the surface of white blood cells enabling them to function better.",

It grows in both dry and damp soil beside rivers or at the top of the hills. It is readily recognized by the roughness of its long branches. It can reach a height of over fifty feet. The dark green or yellowish leaves are covered with tiny yellow hairs and the tip is orange. The bark is very rough.<br>
                                  The healing properties are contained in the fibres of the internal part of the bark which is used either fresh or in a powdered form obtained from the dried bark.",
    'ingredienti_paragrafo_8' => "Properties and Indications for use: the mucilage in the bark lubricates the joints making it an excellent treatment for arthritis. Slippery elm bark is also used for coughs, pharyngitis, and disorders of the nervous system, the stomach and the intestine. It helps urination, reduces swelling and acts as a laxative. It is recommended for use in cases of weakness, pulmonary haemorrhages and ulcers. It is an excellent tonic for the lungs and can be used by people suffering from chronic lung diseases.",
    'ingredienti_paragrafo_9' => "Slippery elm bark contains compounds called mucopolysaccharides or glyco-proteins which are absorbed into the small intestines in their whole form. They have a specific benefit on the immune system and are also able to soothe any inflamed or irritated surfaces. These glyco-proteins are involved in rebuilding the structure of various tissues, and restoring degraded cells that have been overcome by cancer.<br>
                                  It was catalogued by Chinese medicine in 25 B.C. as an excellent remedy for ulcers, diarrhea and colon disorders. In Ayurvedic medicine, it is considered to be nutritious, emulsifying and an expectorant.",

    'ingredienti_paragrafo_13' => "Properties and Indications for use: when the plant is young, it is used in its fresh form as a diuretic and blood purifier.<br>
                                   Sheep sorrel also helps the liver and the intestines and prevents the destruction of red blood cells. It is also used in anti-tumour treatments. The chlorophyll contained within the plant strengthens the cell walls, takes oxygen to the cells and removes deposits in the blood vessels, enabling the body to absorb more oxygen. Chlorophyll can also reduce damage due to radiation, especially to the chromosomes.",
    'ingredienti_paragrafo_14' => "Sheep sorrel is abundant in oxalic acid (also called potassium binoxalate ) which serves to revitalize cellular functions and acts as an \"initiator\" of bodily processes. Potassium binoxalate contains two atoms of oxygen for every atom of potassium; this presence of oxygen is beneficial to cancer patients since cancer is an example of an ailment that occurs in the absence of oxygen.<br>
                                   It is used for inflammatory diseases, tumours, disorders of the kidneys and the urinary tract. Because of the high levels of vitamin C found in the leaves, it is used in the treatment of anaemia and vitamin deficiency.",
    'ingredienti_paragrafo_15' => "Warning: because of the high content of oxalic acid, prolonged use or large doses are not recommended for people suffering from kidney stones.<br>

It helps digestion, purifies the liver, and is used as an anti-tumour treatment.",
    'ingredienti_paragrafo_18' => "Rhubarb has been well-known in the Far East for thousands of years. Its Chinese name is \"Da Hung\" and in Ayurvedic medicine it is known as \"Amla Vetasa\". DeSylva notes that the chrysophanic acid contained in the plant is responsible for the removal of the slimy mucous substance surrounding tumours, thus permitting other plants to reach the tumour mass.",
    'ingredienti_paragrafo_19' => "Warning: Do not use during pregnancy.",

                                      • Purifies the blood.",
    'ingredienti_paragrafo_24' => "In India it is used to stimulate lactation in new mothers and acts as a tonic for the womb (it helps the womb return to normal after birth). DeSylva notes that a substance contained in clover, genistein, is able to block the growth of tumours. This substance accounted for the anticancer effect of the Hoxey formula used about fifty years ago in the treatment of cancer.",

In external use, it checks bleeding and inhibits the growth of bacteria. It is used internally as an astringent, a decongestant, an anti-inflammatory, an antiseptic, a mild diuretic, a haematopoietic (formation of blood or blood cells), a coagulant and a circulatory regulator.",
    'ingredienti_paragrafo_29' => "DeSylva points out that it is the same plant used in India by the mongoose when it is bitten by the cobra. In America, the variety with long leaves is called \"master of the rattlesnake\" and is used to neutralize the poison of a rattlesnake bite.",
    'ingredienti_paragrafo_30' => "<span class='titoletti'>PRICKLY ASH</span><br>Botanical Name: <em>Xanthoxilum fraxineum</em>",

DeSylva adds: \"... it has a history in the treatment of tuberculosis, cholera and syphilis. Recent research has identified a class of substances known as Furano-coumarins. While research still continues, it appears to have a strong effect on cancer. This helps me understand the insistence of the medicine-man I met on the island of Manitoulin, that I include it in the CAISSE FORMULA.\"",
